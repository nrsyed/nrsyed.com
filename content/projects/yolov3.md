This package implements a multithreaded, real-time object detection pipeline
in Python that runs YOLOv3 on a webcam stream, video file, or image, performs
non-maximum suppression to eliminate duplicate detections, and displays the
result. It includes a generalized Darknet parser and can run arbitrary Darknet
architectures, or even a different object detector altogether.
