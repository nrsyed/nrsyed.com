This is a Python package that numerically solves the differential equations
of motion of a half-car suspension model, in which both the suspension
and tires are modeled as spring-damper elements and the road type/profile
can be defined, and aesthetically animates the result with matplotlib. The
example in the package is based on a 2010 Honda Accord, but generalizes to
any four-wheeled vehicle.
