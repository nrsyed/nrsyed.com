Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm currently an R&D engineer with the
[Computer Vision team at Kitware][1], where I develop software and
algorithms for a variety of deep learning and computer vision applications.
I have a BS in Molecular & Cell Biology and an MS in Mechanical Engineering,
and my technical interests include robotic perception and control, autonomous
systems, computer vision, machine learning, and Python, among other things.

The aim of this blog is to share what I've been learning or working on.
