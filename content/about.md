Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm currently an **R&D engineer with the
[Computer Vision group at Kitware][1]** (better known as the company behind
[CMake][5]), where I develop software and algorithms for a variety of deep
learning and computer vision applications. One of the perks of the job is that
I get to tell people I "work in AI."

I have a **BS in Molecular & Cell Biology from UConn** (which involved enough
English Lit electives that I could have minored in it) and an **MS in
Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University** (where my research focused on
human biomechanics and bio-inspired robotics). Before finding my way to
computer science, I was a design engineer developing electromechanical
components for power wheelchairs at **[Quantum Rehab][2]**, and before that,
I briefly spent some time in an immunology research lab at the
**[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases][3]**.

On the technical front, my interests include robotic perception and
control, autonomous systems, computer vision, deep learning, human-machine
interaction, numerical methods, applied math, edge computing/development on
ARM systems, and open source software. Python and C++ are my go-to languages,
Ubuntu is my primary OS, and vim is my editor of choice. If this blog is any
indication, though, I dabble in just about everything.

Aside from engineering, I have a thousand other passions and hobbies, and I'm
always collecting more. A few of them include, in no particular order: physical
fitness (in the form of lifting, running, and all things adjacent), guitar,
writing, chess, skiing, learning foreign languages, [the art of memory][4],
watching bad movies, and buying unfamiliar produce at the grocery store.

The aim of this blog is to document what I've been working on and to share my
thoughts&mdash;mostly for my own gratification, but if somebody else finds it
useful or interesting, all the better.
