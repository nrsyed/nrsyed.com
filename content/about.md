Welcome to my corner of the internet. I currently live in San Francisco,
where I work in the autonomous vehicle space as a Software Engineer on
the Perception team at [Zoox][6] developing deep networks, algorithms,
and infrastructure for the vehicle's radar pipeline. Previously, I was an R&D
Engineer on the Computer Vision team at [Kitware][1] (better known as the
company behind [CMake][5]), where my work mostly involved the training and
deployment of deep networks for applications related to overhead and satellite
imagery.

I have a BS in Molecular & Cell Biology from UConn and an MS in Mechanical
Engineering from Purdue. My MS thesis research focused on human
biomechanics and bio-inspired robotics. Before making the leap to computer
science, I developed electromechanical components for power wheelchairs as a
design engineer at [Quantum Rehab][2], and prior to that, I spent some time
in a malaria immunology research lab as a postbac at the
[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases][3].

On the technical front, my interests include robotic perception, autonomous
systems, and numerical methods. Python and C++ are my go-to languages, Ubuntu
is my primary OS, and vim is my editor of choice. However, if this blog is any
indication, I dabble in just about everything.

Outside of engineering, I juggle a thousand interests and I'm always
collecting more, a few of which include (in no particular order):
strength training, running, [the art of memory][4], guitar, swimming, skiing,
learning foreign languages, cooking with whatever's in the fridge, writing,
chess, watching bad movies and good TV, and buying unfamiliar produce at the
grocery store. I've been told that, as an engineer living in San Francisco,
I'm legally obligated to get into climbing as well, so I might add that to the
repertoire sometime.

The aim of this blog is to document whatever random (technical) things I'm
working on&mdash;mostly for my own gratification, but if somebody else
finds it useful or interesting, all the better.
